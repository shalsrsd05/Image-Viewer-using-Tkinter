# Image-Viewer-using-Tkinter
This is a simple Image Viewer application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to view images from a local folder and navigate through them using Next and Previous buttons. The project helped me understand Python GUI development, event handling, and working with images using the Pillow library.
